- 👋 Hi, I’m @john-hollis
- 👀 I’m interested in ongoing learning as a senior citizen. (65+)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning  with Udemy, the basics of GIT and GitHub. Previously Arduino in 50+ hours and Building with Arduino IoT Cloud.
- 💞️ I’m not currently looking to collaborate on any project, as I feel my coding skills are somewhat limited
  I know a little of, Python, C, Arduino IDE and from a long time ago BASIC, I have used Scratch with the Granchildren.
